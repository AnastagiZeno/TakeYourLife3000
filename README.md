# TakeYourLife3000

*Each one can take charge as chief, take it and good luck, 007*


Firstly, thank Jiasheng and Ptmind, now I have an AWSec2 server that I think I can do anything to it except for destroying it.

In fact I do not know what to do especially in such condition that I do not have enough skills in many fields. so, a blog? github pages might be enough; a slack bot? never;

A web application? A good idea, I just bought two domains at this noon, but what it is for?
